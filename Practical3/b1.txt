[Illustration: Figure made of punctuation]




ROBERT’S first interview with M^R. STOPS.


  Young Robert could read but he gabbled so fast:
  And ran on with such speed, that all meaning he lost.
  Till one Morning he met M^r. Stops by the way,
  Who advis’d him to listen to what he should say.
  Then entering the house, he a riddle repeated.
  To shew, WITHOUT STOPS, how the ear may be cheated.




[Illustration: Two kids]




M^R. STOPS READING TO ROBERT AND HIS SISTER.


      “Ev’ry lady in this land
      “Has twenty nails upon each hand
      “Five & twenty on hands & feet
      “And this is true without deceit.”
    But when the stops were plac’d aright,
    The real sense was brought to light.




[Illustration: Counsellor]




COUNSELLOR COMMA, marked thus ,


      Here counsellor Comma the reader may view,
      Who knows neither guile nor repentance;
      A straight forward path he resolves to pursue
      By dividing short parts of a sentence;
    As “Charles can sing, whistle, leap, tumble, & run,”—
    Yet so BRIEF is each pause, that he merely counts ONE.




[Illustration: Ensign with flag]




ENSIGN SEMICOLON, marked thus ;


    See, how Semicolon is strutting with pride;
    Into two or more parts he’ll a sentence divide.
    As “John’s a good scholar; but George is a better:
    One wrote a fair copy; the other a letter.”
      Without this gay ensign we little could do;
      And when he appears we must pause & count TWO.




[Illustration Colon on a stick]




A COLON, marked thus :


    The colon consists of two dots, as you see:
    And remains within sight whilst you count one, two, three:
    Tis us’d where the sense is complete, tho but part
    Of the sentence you’re reading, or learning by heart.
    As “Gold is deceitful: it bribes to destroy.”
    “Young James is admired: he’s a very good boy.”




[Illustration: Figure holding cloth]




A PERIOD OR FULL STOP,

_marked thus_ .


    The full-fac’d gentleman here shown
    To all my friends, no doubt, is known:
    In him the PERIOD we behold,
    Who stands his ground whilst four are told;
    And always ends a perfect sentence,
    As “Crime is followed by repentance.”




[Illustration: Crooked man]




THE INTERROGATIVE POINT ?


    What little crooked man is this?
    He’s call’d INTERROGATION, Miss:
    He’s always asking this & that,
    As “What’s your name? Whose dog is that?”
      And for your answer, he will stay
      While you, One, Two, Three, Four, can say.




[Illustration: Figure reading]




THE EXCLAMATION POINT !

or Note of Admiration.


    This Youth, so struck with admiration,
    Is of a wondering generation,
    With face so long, and thin and pale,
    He cries, “Oh! what a wonderous tale!”
    While you count four, he stops, and then,
    Admiring! he goes on again.




[Illustration: People on boat]


AN APOSTROPHE ’


    The comma, plac’d as here you see,
    From the word LOV’D has snatch’d a letter;
    It bears the name APOSTROPHE:—
    And, perhaps, you can’t contrive a better.
      In poetry ’tis chiefly found,
      Where sense should coincide with sound.




[Illustration: Figure holding Acute and Grave papers]




A DASH — CIRCUMFLEX ^ BREVE ˘ DIÆRESIS ¨ HYPHEN - ACUTE ACCENT ´ GRAVE
ACCENT ` PARENTHESIS ( )


    A DASH & a CIRCUMFLEX here form a hat;
    A BREVE serves to mark out the face;
    DIÆRESIS, too, & the HYPHEN come pat,
    As a breast & a neck in their place:
    The arms are the ACCENTS, both GRAVE & ACUTE,
    And for legs the PARENTHESIS nicely may suit.




[Illustration:

  YOU
  DON’T SEE

  The use of me.

  Don’t ^{you} see
  a Caret]




A CARET, marked thus ^ .


    If you a letter are inditing
    And make an error in your writing,
    By leaving out a word, or two,
    The CARET may be us’d by you;
    As “This ^{new} book to Charles I send,
    And hope to please ^{my} dearest friend.”




[Illustration: Section figure]




A SECTION, marked thus §.


    This Gentleman of deep reflections,
    Divides a subject into Sections;
    Ideas ranging under heads,
    As gardens are laid out in beds;
    That o’er the whole the eye may move,
    Survey the plan, & then approve.




[Illustration Chapter figure]




A PARAGRAPH ¶.


    The PARAGRAPH, which here you view,
    Always announces something new;
    Distinct from what was read before,
    As is the water from the shore.
      This mark in Scripture oft is found,
      As thriving best on sacred ground.




[Illustration: “Remember me” sign]




A QUOTATION “ ”


      Two commas standing on their heads,
        Their orders are obeying;
      Two others, risen from their beds,
        Their best respects are paying;
    These four are ushers of much use,
    As they great authors introduce.




[Illustration: Figures of punctuation]




BRACKETS OR CROTCHETS [] BRACE } ELLIPSIS __ PARALLELS ∥ OBELISK †
DOUBLE DAGGER ‡ ASTERISK *


    These BRACKETS some words may enclose, without doubt:
          The BRACE several lines will unite;
    ELLIPSIS is us’d where we letters leave out.
          As k—t may be read for a knight.
    The PARALLELS, OB’LISK, & DAGGERS we find,
    Like the ASTERISK only for ref’rence design’d.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
